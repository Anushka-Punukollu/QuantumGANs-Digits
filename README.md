# Quantum GANs - Digits

As the field of Generative AI grows, an area of quantum computing that has gained significant attention in recent years is the development of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (Quantum GANs). With the promise of increased speed and efficiency over classical computing, Quantum GANs have the potential to unlock new possibilities for data processing and analysis.

This is a simple QGan that uses a patch method to generate a handwritten number 0. I used the Pennylane quantum software framework and PyTorch to help code my model.
